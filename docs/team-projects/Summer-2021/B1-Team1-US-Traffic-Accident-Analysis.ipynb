    "Our goal is to find out the factors that influence the occurrence of the number of accidents happening in the United States. We will take factors such as location, weather, and daytime into consideration and use Tableau to provide geographical related visualization. We will make analysis through a large-scale dataset to increase the accuracy of detecting relationships between factors and accident rate. We aim at providing suggestions to DMV and drivers about safe driving. "

    "On Kaggle we found a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3 million accident records in this dataset; therefore, datasets need to be cleaned before conducting analysis. With available dataset, we selected records in each year to see how number of accidents changes in 5 years. \n",
    "In the us accident table, each year contains a great number of data. There is more than 3 million accident records. Considering efficiency when performing analysis on datasets and limitations in terms of data size and budget on Google Cloud Platform, 10% of the data in each year is randomly sampled and unioned into one table.\n",

    "After observing analysis on aspects in location, time and weather conditions, we report US traffic accidents the following:\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "Most traffic accidents occur in coastal areas, such as CA, OR, FL. However, the frequency of serious accidents in FL and NY is higher than that of other states. This might be caused by the excessive traffic and narrow roads in NY and non-pedestrian and bike-friendly roads in FL. Because traffic signal, crossing, and junction were the top 3 frequent locations for traffic accidents, we suggest that police strengthen traffic control at these 3 types of locations with heavy traffic by installing more monitors or warning signs and arranging more patrol officers. Moreover, we discovered that accidents occurred more often around traffic signals during morning peaks and noon breaks. Increasing the number of police to direct traffic flow around traffic signals may lower the occurrence of traffic accidents.\n",
    "</br></br>\n",
    "Over 80% of traffic accidents happened under the weather condition of fair, cloudy, mostly cloudy, partly cloudy and light rain. Most of these accidents have a severity of two, and we don’t see significant portion of accidents having severity of over two happened under other weather conditions. The number of traffic accidents increased as visibility distance went shorter, temperature and precipitation went lower. Thus, more accidents happened in winter. Therefore, DMV can make suggestions in the brochures to call on drive-safe attention specificly in winter.\n",
    "</br></br>\n",
    "In terms of time, we observed that the highest number of accidents occurred between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. and 4:00p.m. and 5:00p.m. daily. The 4 - 5 pm is the peak time for leaving work. However, there were also a high number of accidents between 7am and 8am, at the peak time for work. The number of accidents on weekdays is higher than weekends, and the severity is correspondingly higher. Therefore, the DMV can alert people to be careful when they are out during these hours and drivers need to maintain a cautious attitude. Government can put more police during these hours to control the occurrence of accidents."
