    "Air pollution, as one of the most serious environmental problems confronting our civilization, is the presence of toxic gases and particles in the air at levels that pose adverse effects on global climate and lead to public health risk and disease. Exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants has been implicated in a diverse set of medical conditions including cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, lung cancer and autism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Air pollutants come from natural sources such as wildfires and volcanoes, as well as are highly related to human activities from mobile sources (such as cars, buses and planes) or stationary sources (such as industrial factories, power plants and wood burning fireplaces). However, in the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented changes to the our work, study and daily activities, subsequently led to major reductions in air pollutant emissions. And our team would like take this opportunity to examine the air quality in the past two years and look on how the air quality was impacted in countries and cities where the corona-virus was prevalent."

    "**Data Source Description:** In this project, we downloaded worldwide air quality data for Year 2019 and 2020 from the Air Quality Open Data Platform (https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/), which provides historical air quality index and meteorological data for more than 380 major cities across the world. We used air quality index data in 2019 as baseline to find the air quality changes during COVID in 2020. In addition we joined the data with geographic location information from https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/airquality-covid19-cities.json to get air quality index for each pollutant at city-level. According to the data source provider, the data for each major cities is based on the average (median) of several stations. The data set provides min, max, median and standard deviation for each of the air pollutant species in the form of Air Quality Index (AQI) that are converted from raw concentration based on the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard."

    "The United States EPA list the following as the criteria at this website (https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table): Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Particle Pollution (PM2.5) + (PM10), and finally Sulfur Dioxide (SO2). For the particle pollution the numbers stand for the size of the particles. PM2.5 means particles that are 2.5 micrometers and smaller, while PM10 means particles that are 10 micrometers and smaller. https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics. Particle Pollution typically includes Dust, Dirt, and Smoke. Our dataset covers most of the criteria pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, SO2, NO2 and CO), and meteorological parameters such as temperature, wind speed, dew point, relative humidity. Air quality index basics are shown in the figure below. "

    "We can see an overall AQI changes from 2019 to 2020. However, after running regression for four air pollutants, model R-squares are less than 0.02, indicating a weak linear relationship between the air quality index changes and the numbers of new confirmed COVID cases. The result makes sense because there are complicated physical and chemical process involved in formation and transportation of air pollution, thus factors such as the weather, energy source, and terrain could also impact the AQI changes. Also, the dramatic increase of new COVID cases might not affect people's response in a way reducing outdoor activities, especially when \"stay at home order\" is partially lifted.\n",

    "From the previous regression model we can see that the there was very little correlation between AQI and confirmed cases, and one of the main reasons is that confirmed cases could not accurately capture human activity. To compensate for this, we narrowed down the dates of our pollutant data in order to compare the pollutant levels only during lockdown periods in 2019 and 2020 for the countries where COVID-19 was most prevalent: China, USA, Italy, and those that COVID-19 wasn't as prevalent: Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand. We came to a conclusion that most lockdown periods started from mid March to April, May, or June, except for China, which started their lockdown late January until April of 2020. To generalize the lockdown dates for countries other than China, the SQL query included dates from the beginning of March to the end of June. As for China, the query included specific dates from January 23 to April 8th of 2020, which is the Wuhan 76 day lockdown. "

Initially, we hypothesized that in countries where COVID-19 was more prevalent, and therefore where there were more lockdowns and less human activity, there would be better pollutant levels. However, when looking at the results of the analysis, one can see that the extent to which COVID-19 was prevalent does not seem to largely affect the pollutant parameter levels considering that regardless of the country they seem to have decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. This may be due to various governmental and public policies regarding climate change that have pushed countries to improve the air quality as well as the general decrease in human activity worldwide due to the pandemic."

According to the result, we conclude that the COVID impacts air quality more at regional-level than at global-level, more in a relative short period of time than in a relative long-term. Even though we don't see a strong relationship between air quality changes versus numbers of confirmed COIVD case, we find that lockdowns during the pandemic do make effects on air pollutant levels in different countries due to reduced outdoor human activities."
