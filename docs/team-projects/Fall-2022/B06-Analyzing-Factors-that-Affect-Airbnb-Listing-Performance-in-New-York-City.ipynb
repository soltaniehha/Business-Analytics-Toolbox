    "## Analyzing Factors that Affect Airbnb Listing Performance in New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size='3'><b>Objective - </b> In less than two decades, Airbnb has become one of the major platforms with abundant resources of accommodation offerings. While it continuously maps the needs of guests and hosts, there are evidently some listings or hosts that have higher performance/popularity than others. Therefore, we use this dataset which includes listings’ activity and record in New York, so that we can analyze and visualize contributing factors on host performances. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size='3'><b>Introduction: motivation and goal </b>  \n",
    " 1. Motivation: not only that this analysis might shed some light on hosts’ strategy for their listings, but also that the results of our analysis can help customers to stay in a better location and experience at a more affordable price.\n",
    " 2. Goal: Analyzing different factors about how to contributed to a successful Airbnb host, and what can be done to enhance the experience, customer reviews and attract more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size='3'><b>A report summary</b> \n",
    " - Our project starts with basic and general data exploration, during which we would also do basic data cleaning for a more efficient analysis in later phases. We will present to the audience the descriptions of columns in our dataset. Subsequently, we proceed to look more detailedly at the features of listings, such as geographic distribution, room type, host verification, and availability of listings. After that, we construct scenarios corresponding to different needs of the guests in reality, based on which we focus on flexibility, safety and price level. In addition, the project explores the most preferred and top-priced Airbnb listings probably for luxury travelers using some specific filters resulting from the project preceding analysis. Meanwhile, this particular scenario will reflect some interesting findings. Lastly, we will make a conclusion from which hosts might gain valuable insights, and also reflect on some limitations, which will be followed by the link and screenshot of our dashboard for visualizations."

If that is the case, we can see that the type of shared room has the most evident differentiation on average review rate number, on which we interpret as the difference among price level might have a larger impact on customer review/satisfaction when they stayed in listings belonging to ‘shared room’ type.  Furthermore, there is less availability of shared room type when the listings’ price is either significantly higher than average or comparatively lower than average. This could indicate that customers would rather opt  for either high-price shared room or low-price shared room.\n"

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "Based on our analysis, which focuses on Airbnb host performance in New York city, we make some conclusions, which in turn should provide insight on improvement on host performance:\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. The names of listings could play an important role in getting more attraction and guests. Take, a listing located in Brooklyn, as an example, highlighting the distance to Manhattan in listings name might help to attract more customers, as Manhattan is the center providing various activities in New York city. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Host verification could be crucial in gaining more guests and higher bookings rate in that guests might consider the safety level is higher when the host is verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Having a laundry and kitchen facility improves guests’ experience and subsequently the listing’s review rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hosts of shared rooms should notice that listings in this type are usually higher than or lower than average. This is not to say that hosts should intentionally manipulate the price without any other strategies, but it might be better for them to make prices accordingly: if the listing has a much higher-than-average price, which is a price able to attract customers, the listing should be equipped with corresponding amenities. And vice versa, for hosts who do not intend to significantly increase the guests’ living experience, perhaps they should price the listings lower than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. As mentioned earlier in one of our project subsections, regardless of the required minimum number of nights to stay, listings with flexible cancellation policy have less availability. Therefore, hosts could make their cancellation policy more flexible if situations allow. Furthermore, listings with either flexible or strict cancellation policy are more popular within the same category (min_length_of_stay = ‘Long’). It would become an unsurprising finding when we combine these listings’ average review rate score, which indicates that when the required length of stay is long, guests would start to weigh more on listings’ review rate.\n"

    "## 5. Limitation\n",
    "If time is not limited, we might be able to use machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing to capture preferable patterns for naming listings or formatting house rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather more insight on how to improve host performance, we could have joined other datasets as well. For instance, transportation, air quality, and criminal records in different neighbourhoods or areas can all contribute to the popularity of a listing. These could be all become valuable inputs for any further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our data is limited and the data source does not give a column for the number of transactions per Airbnb, we can only extrapolate from the number of reviews, so errors may occur."
