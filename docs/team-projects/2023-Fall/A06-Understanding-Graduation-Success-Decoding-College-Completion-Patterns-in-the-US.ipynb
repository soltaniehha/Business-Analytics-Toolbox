Unlike excluding them, we retain and incorporate NULL values in our dataset, acknowledging their potential impact on the overall insights derived. As we progress through our queries, we meticulously address and account for NULL values wherever necessary. This approach ensures that our analysis remains inclusive, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data and allowing for a nuanced exploration of relationships and patterns across the Institution Details (1-details), Institution Grads (2-grads), and State Sector Details (3-sectors) tables.We are further analysing the null values and will dig deeper during the final submission."

        "The observed pattern where the mean SAT scores tend to be higher in private not-for-profit schools, followed by public schools, and then private for-profit schools. Some potential explanations can be private not-for-profit schools frequently emphasize academic excellence and may have a more specific mission or focus and more financial resources available for academic programs that attract students with higher SAT scores. Public schools and private for-profit institutions, more diverse and accessible, may serve a broader range of students with varying academic backgrounds. Interestingly, 2-year private for-profit schools have no data for sat scores. This is probably because they may have admissions policies that do not heavily rely on standardized test scores like the SAT. They perhaps prioritize other factors, such as work experience, industry certifications, or specific skill sets for admission."

Conversely, Arizona has the lowest, probably suggesting a more conservative approach in terms of financial allocation for awards, possibly emphasizing efficiency or cost-effectiveness. Interestingly, the number of awards per 100 full-time undergraduates is higher among states with a low amount of money spent per award. This also could mean that schools in these states choose to grant more awards instead of increasing the monetary value to attract students."

        "From this table, we can clearly see that private not-for-profit schools have a higher amount of money spent per award, possibly because many of these schools have substantial endowments and engage in extensive fundraising efforts. This additional financial support allows them to dedicate more resources to awards. Also, private institutions often emphasize providing high-quality education and attracting top-tier students. Offering substantial awards can be a strategy to attract and retain exceptional students, contributing to the institution's reputation and overall excellence. In contrast, private for-profit schools need to consider generating profit, so they may prioritize cost control and allocate fewer resources to awards."

This is because shorter program durations may result in lower overall educational costs, including the costs associated with awards. Additionally, two-year schools primarily focus on preparing students for specific careers or facilitating transfer to four-year schools. As a result, they may alloc,ate fewer resources per award.

        "Adding to the previous questions, we observe that 4-year schools offer higher-value awards than 2-year schools, with Private not-for-profit schools standing out in their efforts to attract top-tier students. Interestingly, 2-year public schools have the smallest number of average awards being offered, while 2-year private for-profit schools have the largest number. This is likely because Private for-profit institutions have more flexibility in awarding scholarships due to their autonomy and less reliance on public funding.\n",
        "In contrast, Public institutions, particularly at the 2-year level, often face budget constraints due to reliance on state funding. Additionally, they may have larger overall student populations. With limited resources, spreading awards across a larger number of students can lead to a smaller number of awards per 100 students and a more selective approach when awarding scholarships, focusing on specific criteria such as academic achievements or financial need."

Schools with higher SAT scores may have a higher level of prestige and potentially more resources. Consequently,These institutions may prioritize offering substantial awards to maintain their reputation and attract top talent. This can also be supported by average aid value. Higher SAT score schools are more generous, providing higher-value financial aid to support and invest in students with exceptional academic abilities. In summary, institutions use financial support for education as a strategic tool to achieve their mission, attract a diverse and talented student body, and enhance their overall standing in the higher education landscape."

        "Regional disparities in SAT scores and graduation rates underscore significant variations in academic achievement throughout the United States. The data reveals a compelling narrative, indicating that 4-year institutions allocate more funding per award compared to their 2-year counterparts. This discrepancy not only reflects differences in program duration but also sheds light on distinct educational expenditure patterns.\n",

        "Furthermore, the impact of institutional characteristics on SAT scores is evident, particularly in research universities and technology-focused schools. These institutions consistently demonstrate higher SAT scores, emphasizing a correlation between academic focus and student achievement. This correlation is particularly noteworthy when considering institutions that prioritize career readiness.\n",

        "Combining these two factors and examining the connection between SAT scores and awards reveals a positive correlation. This observation aligns with the notion that higher SAT score schools tend to be more generous, offering higher-value financial aid to support students with exceptional academic abilities\n",

        "Analyzing graduation rates from 2002 to 2013 provides a comprehensive view of nuanced trends within higher education. On the whole, there is a discernible positive trajectory, reflecting encouraging advancements in graduation outcomes. However, this overall picture conceals the intricate variations existing among different colleges. Notably, some institutions consistently boast high graduation rates, underlining their effectiveness in supporting student success, while others exhibit noticeable fluctuations, signaling potential challenges in maintaining steady progress. When delving deeper into the data, a compelling observation emerges—comparisons between smaller colleges and larger universities reveal distinctive patterns. Smaller institutions may experience more significant fluctuations, possibly due to their unique challenges and resource constraints. This underscores the importance of considering institutional size when evaluating and addressing graduation rate trends, allowing for targeted interventions that can enhance overall higher education outcomes.\n",

        "Due to the potential lengthiness and complexity of listing the annual graduation rate variations for each school from 2002 to 2013, we have narrowed down the analysis to focus on the top three states with the highest graduation rates. The selected approach involves dividing the 12-year period into two six-year segments for each school. The first six years are represented by the school's minimum graduation rate year, while the subsequent six years are represented by the school's maximum graduation rate year. This allows for a more concise yet insightful analysis of the average graduation rate changes within these top-ranking states."

        "As we delve deeper into the intricate landscape of graduation rates and their profound significance for both individual students and the broader standing of universities, it becomes essential to unravel the classification criteria applied to these academic institutions. This exploration gains particular relevance as each student harbors aspirations of attending their dream university, often intertwined with specific goals and ambitions. Within the dataset, two intriguing columns, 'hbcu' and 'flagship,' initially seemed to suggest an exclusive tier of highly competitive universities. However, a closer analysis unveils a more nuanced reality. 'Hbcu' likely denotes Historically Black Colleges and Universities, institutions with a legacy of serving predominantly African American student populations. Conversely, the 'flagship' designation may signify a university's primary and most prominent campus within a broader university system. Contrary to initial assumptions of exclusivity, these classifications encompass a diverse range of institutions, each contributing uniquely to the educational landscape. This insight underscores the importance of moving beyond surface-level interpretations and understanding the specific attributes that define and differentiate universities, shaping the academic journey for aspiring students navigating the intricacies of higher education.\n",

        "The aforementioned findings provide valuable insights that prompt a deeper exploration of these university categories. Despite California boasting the highest number of colleges at 350, Alabama takes the lead in the number of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), with 15 institutions. Noteworthy is the observation that, while each state may host multiple HBCU universities, only one flagship university is designated per state (with the District of Columbia being a unique exception with zero flagship universities). Further investigation into the characteristics defining flagship status reveals that these institutions are typically the oldest public universities and receive the highest levels of government funding.\n",

        "However, it becomes evident that despite holding flagship status, these universities don't necessarily align with the likes of Harvard, Stanford, or MIT. This raises the crucial question: What sets these flagship universities apart from the rest, beyond their public university status?\n",

        "In pursuit of a comprehensive answer, we delved into three key dimensions: awards, SAT scores, and graduation rates, aiming to discern the distinctive attributes of these institutions in comparison to others. By scrutinizing these facets, we aim to unravel the unique qualities that contribute to the prominence of flagship universities, transcending their public university classification."

        "The obtained results shed light on an intriguing aspect: the SAT score does not necessarily serve as a definitive indicator for a university to be classified as a flagship institution. A compelling case for comparison is the state of Massachusetts, where the flagship university, UMASS Amherst, boasts a SAT score of 1209. In contrast, the highest-ranking college in the state, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), significantly surpasses this score with an impressive 1503. This disparity challenges the assumption that a high SAT score is a requisite criterion for a university to attain flagship status. It underscores the complexity of factors influencing such classifications, urging a more nuanced examination beyond standardized test scores to truly discern the distinctive qualities that contribute to a university being designated as a flagship institution."

Each state designates a flagship university, traditionally the oldest public institution with high government funding.\n",

        "Our investigation challenges the belief that a high SAT score is essential for flagship status.

        "The dashboard paint a detailed picture of the diverse landscape of universities, their ownership structures, program durations, expected award values, and the relationship between Median SAT scores and student counts. Firstly, the examination of ownership and funding across states underscores the nuanced nature of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), challenging assumptions about racial segregation exclusively determining ownership. The subsequent categorization of universities based on ownership and program duration reveals that Private for Profit institutions with 4-year programs showcase the highest average expected award values, potentially driven by market demand for these programs. In contrast, Public Universities offering 2-year programs display lower award values on average. The exploration into SAT scores unveils that many Private for Profit universities do not report SAT scores, suggesting alternative admissions criteria. The scatter plot analysis further emphasizes a positive correlation between Median SAT values and average expected award values, notably pronounced for Public schools and also applicable to engineering schools and research universities with high research activities. Delving deeper into university types, School of Engineering and research universities emerge with the highest SAT values, while Associate-Public Urban-serving Multicampus stands out with the least Median SAT value at 756. Collectively, these insights provide a holistic view of the varied factors influencing universities, from ownership and program durations to admissions criteria and the intricate relationship between SAT scores and expected award values."

        "##6.2 Dashboard 2(Graduation Rates Dashboard):\n",
        "The dashboard, with its focus on graduation rates across states and regions in each year, provides valuable insights into the quality of education and potential challenges in completing programs. The Geo Maps highlight distinct variations in graduation rates, with states like the District of Columbia, Rhode Island, New York, and New Hampshire consistently demonstrating high graduation rates. In contrast, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alaska, and North Dakota appear to face challenges with lower graduation rates. The regional analysis underscores the Northeast region's consistent outperformance in both Grad_100 and Grad_150 rates, indicating a potential regional advantage in educational outcomes. Conversely, the South West region consistently exhibits a minimal range in graduation rates, suggesting possible difficulties in program completion. Integrating insights from a previous dashboard, the correlation between graduation rates and SAT scores becomes apparent. Institutions with higher SAT scores tend to exhibit higher graduation rates, aligning with the notion that students with elevated SAT scores demonstrate a greater level of academic preparedness. Additionally, higher SAT score schools may have access to greater resources and academic support services, contributing to the positive correlation observed. Collectively, these insights provide a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing graduation rates, including geographical variations, regional trends, and the impact of academic preparedness as reflected by SAT scores."

Consequently, when we use these filters, the charts in the dashboard won't appear as congested. The information filtered out will also be more clearly visible."

        "**Navigating the Educational Landscape: Insights into University Selection, Funding Dynamics, and Institutional Characteristics**\n",
        "\n",
        "Regional academic disparities in the U.S. are evident as institutions showcase distinct funding patterns per award. Institutional characteristics impact SAT scores, highlighting a correlation between academic focus and achievement. Combining these factors reveals a positive connection between SAT scores and awards, suggesting higher SAT score schools are more generous.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis unveils graduation rate patterns, with Rhode Island consistently leading and Northeastern private nonprofits outperforming. Two-year private for-profit and four-year private not-for-profit institutions maintain high graduation rates. Geographically, New York leads in 4-year colleges, while California leads in 2-year colleges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher SAT score groups achieve better graduation outcomes, indicating a positive relationship. This upward trend aligns with a significant correlation between Median SAT scores and graduation rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Diversity is evident in university distribution, with flagship universities excelling in awards and graduation rates. Financial aid insights reveal quirks, with popular colleges being more generous.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the academic landscape, 2 million students opt for Research Universities, while Masters Colleges and Universities allure with greater enrollment. The average SAT score paints a nuanced tale of aspirations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dashboard explores ownership structures, program durations, expected award values, and the relationship between Median SAT scores and student counts. Private for-profit institutions with 4-year programs showcase the highest average expected award values. Many Private for Profit universities do not report SAT scores, suggesting alternative admissions criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "The graduation rates dashboard provides insights into education quality, highlighting distinct variations in graduation rates through Geo Maps. The Northeast consistently outperforms, indicating a potential regional advantage. The correlation between graduation rates and SAT scores becomes apparent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collectively, these insights offer a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing graduation rates, including geographical variations, regional trends, and the impact of academic preparedness reflected by SAT scores."

        "\n",
        "In this project, our initial intention was to merge the current university rankings table to investigate potential correlations between university rankings, graduation rates, SAT scores, and awards. However, due to uncertainty regarding the linkage of the 'unitid' in the original dataset with the 'unitid' in the university rankings table, we have decided to forgo this idea in this report. We hope to establish this connection in future analyses. Additionally, it's crucial to note that the dataset used here is a decade old, which may impact the relevance of the analysis to present-day universities. We look forward to working with more up-to-date datasets in the future for more accurate insights. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that the dataset contains numerous missing values, particularly in SAT scores, awards, and graduation rates. A more comprehensive dataset in the future would undoubtedly facilitate a more thorough analysis."
