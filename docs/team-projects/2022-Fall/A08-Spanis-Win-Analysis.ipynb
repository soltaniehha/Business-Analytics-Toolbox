        "According to a recent trend, the Spanish wine market is experiencing a steady decline beginning in 2022. Based on preliminary research, this was due to inefificient supply chain management and lack of understanding of the demand for various categories of wine. Although people's preferences for wine vary greatly when compared to other beverages, we hope to provide valuable insights and recommendations to distributors through this project."

We found a few trends we believe would be useful for them. Based on these trends and information about the wine supply chain, we've provided recommendations on which wineries are the most profitable, which wines have more scope, and which varieties they should put a hold on. We've also analysed the consumer response for different categories that would be very helpful to them."

        "In our analysis on wines, wineries, price, and customer response, we report the following findings that are aimed towards helping distributors who are invlolved in spanish wine distribution make customer friendly choices(Supporting data is available in the queries)-\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Distributors should pick wineries that are doing well because it costs the them money to create and maintain a supply chain channel that allows them to source wines from each winery. It's a smarter choice to do business with wineries that produce consistently highly rated wines and those that get the most interest. We could notice that *'Vega Sicilia'* is one such well performing winery according to our datset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Similar to the previous point, distributors should put a hold on working with low performing wineries. The investment into maintaining a supply chain channel to these wineries does not yield as much profit. Few such wineries we found in our analysis are *Francisco Barona*, *Pago de Vallegarcia*, *Bodegas Naluar & Acediano*, *Hacienda Grimon*, *Pago de Los Capellanes*.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. We observed that all types of red wine have a large number of customers, but they are mostly not satisfied, as evidenced by the low ratings. More research and procurement has to be done in this area as red wine displays a huge potential according to our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Establishing a trade channel in multiple wineries of the same region is usually more profitable logistically. Instead of maintaining trade channels in regions with very few or no well-performing wineries, we recommend working in regions such as *Ribera del Duero*, which has the highest number of distinct wines, and *Rioja*, which has the highest number of distinct wines. This way they can either cover wines that are mostly loved by consumers or make sure they've a wide variety of options with optimal number of trade channels.\n"

        "We also investigated if there is a positive relationship between year and price. Our histogram below supports the general belief that the older the wine, the higher the prices, keeping the country of origin constant. As illustrated in the descending and ascending tables, the median wine price in 1965 is the highest at €1,515 per bottle, while the median wine price in 2021 is only €13 per bottle. The reason for using median wine price as a metric is to remove outlier's impact."
